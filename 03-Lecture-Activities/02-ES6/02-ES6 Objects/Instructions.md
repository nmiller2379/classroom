# Objects, prototypal inheritance and getters and setters
These activities will help you practice some of the concepts we discussed in our lecture.

## 1. Create a Person
**Objective:** Practice using getters and setters.
**Instructions:** 
- Your task is to create a Person object with properties like name and age.
- Implement getters and setters for each property to ensure that data validation and encapsulation are maintained. Ensure the age is a number and greater than 0. Ensure the name is a string.

## 2. Prototype Chain
**Objective:** Practice using prototypal inheritance.
**Instructions:**
- Your goal is to build a chain of objects using prototypal inheritance. Create a parent object, a child object and a grandchild object
- Begin with a base object and create child and grandchild objects that inherit properties and methods from their parent objects. Give the child and grandchild their own methods in addition to enherited methods. Use them to see what happens.
