# Module practice
Complete this activity to practice using ES6 modules.

**Setup:**

You are given two directories, each with a JavaScript file inside.

**Task:**

Starting with this given setup compmlete the following tasks. Your goal is to organize the code using ES6 modules:
- Each file should export something useful.
- Create an `index.html` and ensure it is setup to use modules.
- Create a main module (like index.js or app.js) to import and use these exports.
- Working in `capital.js`, `multiplication.js` and `divide.js` write the appropriate code and export it so it can be used in your main module.
When you're done, your main module should work without errors and achieve a specific task or feature. We should see the results in your console.
