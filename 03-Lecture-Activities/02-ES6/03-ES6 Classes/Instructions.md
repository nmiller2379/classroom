# Class activities
Theese activities will help you practice with ES6 Classes.

## 1. Rectangle
**Objective:** Implement a class and its methods to simulate a simple scenario.

**Instructions:**
- Define a class named Rectangle.
- Add properties width and height to the Rectangle class constructor.
- Implement a method named calculateArea() that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle (width * height).
- Implement a method named calculatePerimeter() that calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle (2 * (width + height)).
- Create instances of the Rectangle class with different dimensions and test the methods to ensure they produce correct results.

## 2. Shapes
**Objective:** Practice inheritance by creating subclasses and overriding methods.

**Instructions:**
- Define a base class named Shape with a method describe() that logs a description of the shape.
- Create two subclasses: Circle and Square.
- Inherit from Shape and override the describe() method in both subclasses to provide shape-specific descriptions.
- Add additional properties as needed for each subclass (e.g., radius for Circle, side length for Square).
- Create instances of Circle and Square, call the describe() method on each instance, and observe the output to ensure correct inheritance and method overriding.
