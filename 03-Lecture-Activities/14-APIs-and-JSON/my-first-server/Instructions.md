# Assignment: Build and Test a Simple Express Server

## Objective
Create an Express server with four API routes, then test these routes using Insomnia.

## User Stories

1. **Set Up the Project**
   - As a developer, I want to initialize a Node.js project and install Express (this is already done for you: work in a copy of your `express-template`) so that I can create a server.

2. **Create the Server**
   - As a developer, I want to write code that creates an Express server so that it can listen on port 8080.

3. **Define the Routes**
   - As a developer, I want to create the following API routes so that I can handle different types of HTTP requests:
     - A GET route that returns a simple message.
     - A POST route that returns a message confirming the creation of a resource.
     - A PUT route that returns a message confirming the update of a resource.
     - A DELETE route that returns a message confirming the deletion of a resource.

4. **Handle Dynamic Routes (optional)**
   - As a developer, I want to define a route with parameters (e.g., `/users/:userId/books/:bookId`) so that I can capture dynamic data from the URL and return it in the response.

5. **Test the Routes**
   - As a developer, I want to use Insomnia to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to my server so that I can verify that each route works as expected.

6. **Run and Validate**
   - As a developer, I want to run my server and test all routes in Insomnia so that I can ensure my server is functioning correctly.
