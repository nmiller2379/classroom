# Simplified Recipe Book Application
Working in your `basic-react-template` complete this activity by fulfilling the user stories below. Manage state with the `useReducer` hook.

This application is slightly more complex than the counter application. If you get stuck and need help, be sure to consult the react documentation, which explains useReducer. Here is a link to get you started: https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer
