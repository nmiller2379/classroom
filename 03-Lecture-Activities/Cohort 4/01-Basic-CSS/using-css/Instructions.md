### Title: Adding Basic CSS to Semantic City
For this activity, you'll use the HTML code you refactored to include semantic elments. Open that folder in VSCode and add a `style.css` document. You can do this in your command line by using the command `touch style.css` at the root of your activity directory. Link the `style.css` document  you created to your `index.html` document. Then you'll work in that `style.css` document to fulfill the user stories below.

#### **User Story 1: Link an External Stylesheet**
As a student learning CSS, I want to create and link an external stylesheet so that I can separate content and presentation in the Semantic City project.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create a `styles.css` file in the same folder as the HTML file.
- Link the stylesheet to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

#### **User Story 2: Apply a Font Style**
As a student learning CSS, I want to apply a font-family to the entire page so that the text looks cleaner and more professional.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Use a common sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica) as the default for the whole page.
- Write a CSS rule for the `body` element to set the font-family.

#### **User Story 3: Change the Background Color**
As a student learning CSS, I want to set a background color for the webpage so that it has some visual appeal.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Choose a light background color (e.g., light gray or light blue) for the `<body>` element.

#### **User Story 4: Style Headings**
As a student learning CSS, I want to style the headings on the page so that they stand out more.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Write a CSS rule for the `<h1>` element to increase its font size.
