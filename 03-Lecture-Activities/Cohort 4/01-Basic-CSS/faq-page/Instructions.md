# FAQ page activity

This activity is a Frequently Asked Questions page for a fictional business. It is complete when all the user stories are fulfilled.

- **User Story #1**: As a user, I expect the FAQ page to include an `<h1>` element at the top, serving as the main heading. The `<h1>` should have a background color of `#f4f4f4`, centered text, and padding of `10px` for readability. Additionally, each question and its corresponding answer should be appropriately structured with subheadings (`<h2>`) styled with `font-size: 1.5em` and `border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd`.

- **User Story #2**: As a user visiting the FAQ page, I should see an ordered list of questions at the top of the page, with each question serving as a clickable link. The ordered list (`<ol>`) should have `list-style-type: decimal;`, with `margin-left: 20px`, and each link (`<a>`) should be `color: blue;` and change to `color: darkblue;` on hover.

- **User Story #3**: As a user, I should be able to visually distinguish the questions in the ordered list from the rest of the content, ensuring clarity on which items are clickable links. Each question in the list should have a `padding: 5px;`, `font-weight: bold;`, and be separated with `margin-bottom: 5px;`.

- **User Story #4**: As a user, when I click on a question in the ordered list, the page should take the user to that question. The questions should be wrapped in `<section>` elements with `10px` of padding to clearly define sections.

- **User Story #5**: As a user, I should be able to easily navigate back to the top of the page by clicking a link or button, ensuring a convenient way to explore other questions. The "Back to Top" link should have a `display: block;`, `text-align: center;`, `margin-top: 20px;`, and `font-size: 1.2em;`.

- **User Story #6**: As a user, I expect the ordered list of questions to be logically organized, providing a clear and structured layout that enhances the overall usability of the FAQ page. The page should use `max-width: 800px;` and `margin: auto;` for a clean layout.

- **User Story #7**: As a user, I expect to be able to easily tell where one answer ends and another begins. Each answer should be separated from the other with a horizontal line styled as `border-top: 2px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;`.

- **User Story #8**: As a user, I expect to be able to interact with the company in other ways. Within at least one answer, I want to be able to click on at least one link to another page on the company's website, such as the home page or return policy. These links should be styled with `color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;` and should change to `color: #004499;` when hovered over.
