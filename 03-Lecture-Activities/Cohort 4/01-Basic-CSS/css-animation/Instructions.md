# Beating Heart

In this activity, you'll create a beating heart using HTML and CSS. To complete the activity, fulfill the user stories below.

### **1. As a student, I want to create a visually appealing beating heart animation so that I can understand how CSS animations work.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The heart should increase and decrease in size rhythmically.
  - The animation should be smooth and loop continuously.

---

### **2. As a student, I want to use @keyframes so that I can learn how to control animations with CSS.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - I should define a `@keyframes` rule that changes the heart’s size.
  - I should apply the animation to an HTML element using CSS.

---

### **3. As a student, I want to use the `transform: scale()` property so that I can change the size of the heart without affecting its position.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The heart should grow and shrink without shifting its position.
  - The scaling effect should be centered on the heart.

---

### **4. As a student, I want to adjust the animation duration and timing function so that the heart beats in a natural, rhythmic way.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - I can modify the `animation-duration` to speed up or slow down the beat.
  - I can use `ease-in-out` or `linear` timing functions for a smoother effect.

---

### **5. As a student, I want to add a slight color or opacity change during the animation so that the beating effect feels more dynamic.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The heart should subtly change in opacity or color as it beats.
  - The color transition should be smooth.

---

### **6. As an instructor, I want students to complete this project with minimal CSS properties so that they focus on learning animations without being overwhelmed.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Students should use only essential properties like `@keyframes`, `transform`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-iteration-count`.
  - Students should not need to use JavaScript for the animation.

---

### **7. As an instructor, I want to include a challenge question asking students to modify the heart’s beat speed so that they experiment with timing adjustments.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The challenge should ask students to change the `animation-duration` to make the beat faster or slower.
  - The challenge should encourage trial and error to observe the effect.

---

### **8. As a user with visual impairments, I want the animation to be non-intrusive so that it does not cause discomfort or distraction.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The animation should not flash or change too rapidly.
  - There should be an option to disable animations via CSS (e.g., `prefers-reduced-motion`).
