**Title: Majority Element**

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n/2⌋` times.

**Additional Details:**
- You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `nums = [3,2,3]`
- Output: `3`

**Example 2:**
- Input: `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`
- Output: `2`

**Example 3:**
- Input: `nums = [1]`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: The only element is the majority.

**Constraints:**
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

---

The problem statement specifies that the majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times. This means that the majority element appears in more than half of the positions in the array.
