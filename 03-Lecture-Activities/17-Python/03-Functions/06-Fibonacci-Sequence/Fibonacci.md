# Fibonacci Sequence

**Objective:** Write a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

**Example:**
```python
fibonacci(10) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
fibonacci(5) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```
### About the Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. It is defined by the recurrence relation: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with seed values F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. In other words it is a sequence of numbers in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
