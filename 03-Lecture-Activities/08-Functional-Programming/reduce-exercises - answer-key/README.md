1. Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns the average of the values in the array. For example, [5, 7, 5, 7, 6] => 6

2. Given an array of numbers return a string of one number. For example, [1, 2, 3] => "123". For the purpose of this exercise don't use the .join() method.

3. Given an array of wishlist objects with title and price properties, write a function that returns the total cost of purchasing all the items. For example: [{ title: "Tesla Model S", price: 90000 }, { title: "diamond ring", price: 45000 }, { title: "Purebred cat", price: 1000 },{ title: "77-inch HDR TV", price: 2000 }, { title: "Another Tesla Model S", price: 90000 },] => 228000.

4. Given a multidimensional array, write a function that returns a flattened array. For example: [["1", "2", "3"],[true],[4, 5, 6]] => ["1", "2", "3", true, 4, 5, 6]

5. Given an array of numbers, some of which are duplicative, write a function that removes the duplicated numbers and returns a new array containing only those numbers, which were not duplicated in the passed array. For example: [2, 5, 7, 5, 12, 9, 7, 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 15] => [2, 5, 7, 12, 9, 4, 3, 15]
