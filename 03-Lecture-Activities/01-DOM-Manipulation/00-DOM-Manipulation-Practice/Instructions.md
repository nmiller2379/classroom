# DOM Manipulation Practice

These activities will help you practice some of the DOM Manipulation Skills we discussed in our lecture. They might also require a little research. Check out [HTML DOM Element textContent](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_textcontent.asp) and the [HTML DOM Style Object](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp) on w3Schools.

## Complete each activity in its directory

Each activity has its own directory, which includes some HTML code, which you do NOT need to change manually and a `script.js` file in which you can complete the activity. Once completed, you should be able to see the changes to the webpage in your browser.
