# Debugging
This activity will help you practice some of the debugging techniques discussed in the lecture.

## Debugging a calculator
**Objective:** Improve your JavaScript debugging skills by identifying and fixing bugs in a simple calculator application. This activity will help you practice using browser Developer Tools, applying debugging techniques, and understanding JavaScript code flow and logic.

**Background:** You have been given a basic HTML and JavaScript code for a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, the calculator is not working as expected due to several bugs in the JavaScript code.

### Task Description
Your task is to debug and fix the calculator application. The application is supposed to take two numeric inputs and perform the selected mathematical operation when the user clicks the "Calculate" button. The result should be displayed on the page.

### Instructions
**Identify the Bugs:** Use the provided HTML and JavaScript code. Load the HTML page in a browser and try using the calculator with different operations. Notice any incorrect behavior.

**Open Developer Tools:** Use the browserâ€™s developer tools to help identify the bugs. Look for any errors in the console, and use the `debugger;` statement to step through the code.

**Fix the Bugs:** Apply your debugging skills to fix the errors. Consider the following while debugging:

1. Are the input values being read correctly?
2. Is the arithmetic operation performed correctly (including division by 0)?
3. How are the input values being treated (e.g., strings vs. numbers)?
4. Is the result being displayed as expected?
5. Test Your Fixes: After applying your fixes, test the calculator thoroughly with various inputs and operations to ensure it works correctly. 

**Reflect:** Think about the debugging process you used. Which tools and techniques were most helpful? How did you identify and resolve each bug?
