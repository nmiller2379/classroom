# Activities

These activities will help you practice with some of the methods on the Math object as well as ternary operators.

## 1. Random Numbers

Write a function in JavaScript that generates and returns both a random fraction and a random whole number. Utilize the concepts of Math.random() and Math.floor().

## 2. Convert String to Integer

Create a function that takes a numeric string as an argument and uses the parseInt function to convert it into an integer. Return the converted integer.

## 3. Absolute Value

Build a function that takes a number as input, uses the Math.abs() function to calculate its absolute value, and returns the result.

## 4. Binary Decimal Converter

Write a JavaScript function that takes a binary string as input, converts it to a decimal number using parseInt and returns the result.

## 5. Temperatue Verifier

Write a JavaScript function called temperatureVerifier that takes the current temperature as input and uses ternary operators to determine the weather condition. The conditions are as follows:

- If the temperature is less than 0 degrees Celsius, return "Freezing".
- If the temperature is between 0 and 10 degrees Celsius (inclusive), return "Cold".
- If the temperature is between 11 and 20 degrees Celsius (inclusive), return "Moderate".
- If the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius, return "Warm".
