# Activities for Recursion Practice
These activities will help you practice recursion. Complete the activites. Remember to always have a base case.

### Sum of Digits:
- **Activity:** Write a recursive function to find the sum of the digits of a given positive integer.
- **Instructions:** Implement a recursive function that takes an integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. Test your function with various numbers, ensuring it handles both small and large values. HINT: To solve this problem, we have to be able to isolate the digits. We have some tools to help us with this: Specificially the `%` and `Math.floor()`.

### Power Calculation:
- **Activity:** Implement a recursive function for exponentiation.
- **Instructions:** Write a recursive function that calculates the result of raising a given base to a specified exponent. Test your function with different base and exponent values, and compare the results with built-in exponentiation operators.

### String Reversal:
- **Activity:** Reverse a string using recursion.
- **Instructions:** Create a recursive function to reverse a given string. Test the function with different input strings, including those with spaces and special characters. This one may push you a little. You may find it helpful to use in creating your reversed string.
