# JavaScript Loops
Complete these activities to practice using loops.

## 1. Factorial Factory
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number. The function should take a number as an argument and use a while loop to calculate its factorial. A factorial as a way to multiply a number by all the smaller whole numbers leading up to 1. For instance, the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is the product of multiplying 5 by 4, then by 3, then by 2, and finally by 1. It's a mathematical operation that often comes up in various calculations, denoted by an exclamation mark after the number. For example, 5! equals 120.

## 2. Sum of an Array
Write a function that takes an array of numbers an returns the sum of the array. The function should take an array as an argument and use a for...of loop to calculate the sum of its elements.

## 3. Persistant Printing
Write a function that to repeatedly prints "JavaScript is fun" until a passed count is reached. The function should use a do... while loop so that the message prints at least once.

## 4. Delightfully Doubled
Write a function that generates and prints the first N terms of a sequence where each term is the double of the previous term. Use a for loop to generate the first N terms of the sequence. Each term in the sequence should be double the value of the previous term. Print each term in the sequence. For example, if N = 5, print the following sequence:
Term 1: 1
Term 2: 2 
Term 3: 4 
Term 4: 8 
Term 5: 16 

## 5. Doubled Object
Given an object, write a function that doubles all numeric values of the passed object and returns a new object that is a duplicate of the passed object but with the numeric values of the passed object doubled. The function should use a for ... in loop to iterate through the passed object and use the type of operator to check whether a value is numeric. Here is more information about typeof: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof

Use this object to test your function:
```
{ a: 5, b: "Hello", c: 10, d: "World" }
```
Then, create your own object and test the function with that.
