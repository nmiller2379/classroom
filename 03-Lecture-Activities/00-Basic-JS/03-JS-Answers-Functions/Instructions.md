# JavaScript Functions: 
Complete these activities to practice with using functions in JavaScript.

## 0. Sample Function:
- Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of those numbers.

## 1. Calculate and Return:
- Write a function named calculateArea that takes the length and width as parameters and returns the area of a rectangle.
- Call the function with different values and log the results.

## 2. Scope Exploration:
- Declare a variable globalVar outside any function, and log its value inside and outside a function.
- Create a function with a local variable and log its value inside and outside the function.

## 3. Understanding Undefined:
- Write a function called noReturn that doesn't have a return statement.
- Call the function and log the result to observe the default undefined return.

## 4. Assign and Use Return Value:
- Create a function named calculateSquare that takes a number as a parameter and returns its square.
- Call the function and assign the result to a variable. Use the variable in a subsequent operation.

## 5. Void vs. Returning Functions:
- Write two functions: one that logs a message directly (void function) and another that returns a greeting message.
- Call both functions and observe the differences in their usage.

## 6. Global vs. Local Challenge:
- Declare a variable with the same name globally and locally within a function.
- Log both variables to observe how scope affects their values.

## 7. Mixing it Up:
- Create a function that takes two parameters, multiplies them, and returns the result.
- Call the function with a mix of numbers and variables as arguments.
