# Conditional Exercises
These exercises will provide some practice using conditionals and comparison operators.

## 1.  Temperature Classifier:
Create a function that takes an input a temperature and uses conditional statements to classify it as hot, warm, or cold. Based on the temperature, return a string of "hot", "warm," or "cold". Experiment with different temperature ranges.

## 2. Grades Calculator:
Create a function that take a numerical grade and uses if-else statements to determine the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

## 3. Traffic Light Simulator:
Write a function that simulates a traffic light using a switch statement. Based on the input (red, yellow, green), return the corresponding action ("stop", "prepare to stop", "go"). 

## 4. Number Analyzer:
Write a function that takes a number and uses if-else statements to determine if it's "positive", "negative", or "zero". Experiment with different scenarios, including non-numeric input. 

## 5. Calendar Function:
Create a function that takes a numerical month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and uses a conditional to display the number of days in that month. Test your function with various inputs to ensure accurate results.
