# JavaScript Basics Exercises
Working on your computer, create a directory for these exercises. Create a `script.js` file and an `index.html` file. Connect the two. Work in your `script.js` file to compelete these activities.

## Exercise 0: Variable Declaration

- Declare a variable named `age` and assign your age to it.
- Print the value of the variable to the console.
- Expected output in the console: You should see the value of `age` in the console.

## Exercise 1: String Manipulation

- Declare two string variables, `firstName` and `lastName`.
- Concatenate them and store the result in a new variable called `fullName`.
- Print `fullName` to the console.
- Expected output in the console: You should see the full name in the console.

## Exercise 2: Block Scope Understanding

- Create a block using curly braces `{}`.
- Declare a variable `blockVariable` inside the block and assign a value.
- Attempt to access `blockVariable` outside the block and observe the result.

## Exercise 3: Data Types

- Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2`, assign "100" to `num1` and 100 to `num2`.
- Use the `typeof` operator to print the data type of `num1` and `num2` in your console.
- Expected output in the console: 
```
string 
number
```
HINT: Checkout `typeof` on MDN for more information.

## Exercise 4: Updated Constant Challenge

- Declare a constant variable named `gravity` and assign the value of Earth's gravitational acceleration (approximately 9.8 m/sÂ²).
- Print the gravitational acceleration value stored in `gravity` to the console.
- Try to reassign a new value to `gravity` and observe the result.
