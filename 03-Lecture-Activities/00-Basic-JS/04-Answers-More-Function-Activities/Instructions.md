# JavaScript Function Practice Activities

Here are some additional activites to practice with functions. These activities build on your knowledge of strings, arrays, and math operations while helping you practice writing functions.

---

## 1. Multiply It
**Description:**  
Write a function called `multiplyByFive` that takes a number and returns that number multiplied by 5.  
**Example:**
```js
multiplyByFive(2); // returns 10
```

---

## 2. Say It Twice
**Description:**  
Write a function called `sayTwice` that takes a string as input and returns that string repeated twice.  
**Example:**
```js
sayTwice("hi"); // returns "hihi"
```

---

## 3. Make a List
**Description:**  
Write a function called `makeList` that takes three values and returns them as an array.  
**Example:**
```js
makeList("apples", "bananas", "pears"); // returns ["apples", "bananas", "pears"]
```

---

## 4. Find the First Letter
**Description:**  
Write a function called `lastLetter` that takes a string and returns just the last character.  
**Example:**
```js
firstLetter("JavaScript"); // returns "t"
```

---

## 5. Add Then Round
**Description:**  
Write a function called `addAndRound` that takes two numbers, adds them together, and returns the **rounded result**.  
**Example:**
```js
addAndRound(3.4, 2.7); // returns 6
```
---

## ✨ Stretch: Combine First and Last
**Description:**  
Write a function called `firstAndLast` that takes a string and returns a new string made up of **only the first and last characters**.  
**Example:**
```js
firstAndLast("banana"); // returns "ba"
firstAndLast("dog");    // returns "dg"
```
---

## ✨ Stretch: Sum the Ends
**Description:**  
Write a function called `sumEnds` that takes an array of numbers and returns the **sum of the first and last numbers** in the array.  
**Example:**
```js
sumEnds([3, 7, 2]);     // returns 5
sumEnds([10, 4, 8, 6]); // returns 16
```

**REMINDER:** Because functions are reusable code, your functions must work not only for the provided example inputs but also for all similar inputs.
