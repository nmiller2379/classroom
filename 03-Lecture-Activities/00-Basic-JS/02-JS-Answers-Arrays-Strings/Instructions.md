# String and array activities
These activities offer the chance to practice the stuff we covered in the lecture.

1. ## Bracket Notation Exploration
Description: Given a string, use bracket notation to access and display individual characters at various positions within the string.
Example: If the string is "JavaScript," retrieve and display the characters at positions 2, 5, and 8.

2. ## Array Manipulation Challenge:
Description: Create an array of your favorite fruits. Apply array manipulation techniques such as adding, removing, and modifying elements. Experiment with different methods like push, pop, shift, and unshift.

3. ## Multi-Dimensional Array Puzzle:
Description: Given a multi-dimensional array representing a 3x3 matrix, write JavaScript code to access and display specific elements within the matrix using nested indexes.
Example: Access and display the value at the second row and third column.
```javascript
let matrix = [
    [11, 12, 13],
    [14, 15, 16],
    [17, 18, 19]
];

```

4. ## Find the index of elements:
Description: Given the array `["apple", "strawberry", "peach"]`, return the index value of "strawberry". Also return the index value of "Carl"

5. ## Change the word
Description: Given a word such as "hello", write a program to change the word to "Jello".
Hint: Use some of the string and array methods we discussed in the lecture to accomplish this.
