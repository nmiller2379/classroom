# JavaScript Practice Exercises (Decimals, compound assignment and strings)
These exercises are an opportunity to practice what we've discussed in the lecture. Create an index.html and a script.js. Connect the two and complete the exercises in your script.js file.

## Decimal Operations:

- Create two variables, `num1` and `num2`, both containing decimal numbers.
- Calculate the product and quotient of these two numbers.
- Display the results with meaningful console log messages.

## Compound Assignment:

- Initialize a variable `counter` with an integer value.
- Use compound assignment to add 5, subtract 2, multiply by 3, and then divide by 2.
- Display the final value of the `counter` variable.

## String Length:

- Declare a variable `message` and assign a sentence of your choice to it.
- Find and display the length of the message using the `length` property.
- Modify the message by adding another sentence, and again display the updated length.

## Precision Handling:

- Create variables `numA` and `numB` with decimal values.
- Add them together and display the result without handling precision.
- Now, use a method like `toFixed()` to round the result to two decimal places and display the corrected value.

## Stretch  yourself a bit
This challenge is a bit tougher and it does use some concepts we haven't expressly discussed in JavaScript, but we have done things like it in pseudocode. See if you can get a JavaScript implementation of it. Use your resources if you get stuck.

### String Reversal:

- Declare a variable `originalString` and assign it a string of your choice.
- Write a function called `reverseString` that takes a string as an argument and returns its reverse.
- Call the `reverseString` function with the `originalString` and store the result in a new variable.
- Display both the original string and the reversed string using `console.log()`.
- Call it with another string and display the result in the console.
