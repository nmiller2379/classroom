# Serving a simple form
This activity is designed to help you practice serving a simple form with an Express.js server. To complete this activity, work in a copy of your `express-and-mongoose` template. You can copy your form, your server and your public directory from your earlier activity into this template, or you can simply start from scratch here. The choice is yours. 

1. **Form Layout**
   - As a user, I want to see a form with fields for First Name, Last Name, and Age, so that I can enter my personal information.

2. **Form Submission**
   - As a user, I want the form to have a "Submit" button, so that I can submit my information after filling out the form.

3. **Form Styling**
   - As a user, I want the form to be visually appealing with styled input fields and buttons, so that the form is easy to use and navigate.

4. **Server Setup**
   - As a user, I want to access the form by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/form`, so that I can fill out and submit my information.

5. **Static File Serving**
   - As a developer, I want to serve the form's HTML and CSS files from an Express server, so that users can access the form and view it with the appropriate styles.

6. **Form Validation**
   - As a user, I want to be notified if any fields are left empty when I submit the form, so that I can ensure all necessary information is provided. 

7. **Database Connection**
   - As a developer, I want to set up a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, so that I can store and retrieve data from a persistent data store.

8. **Data Model Creation**
   - As a developer, I want to define a Mongoose schema for a User, with fields for First Name, Last Name, and Age, so that the form data can be stored in a structured format in the database.

9. **Handling Form Submission**
   - As a user, I want my form submission to send the data to the server where it is stored in the MongoDB database, so that my information is saved for future reference.

10. **Success Feedback**
    - As a developer, after submitting the form, I want to receive a confirmation message or be redirected to a success page, indicating that my data has been successfully stored.

11. **Error Handling**
    - As a developer, I want to be informed if there is an error during the form submission process, so that I can understand if something went wrong and my data was not saved.
