# Memory Match Challenge
Your task is to create a memory game. You can do this working in a copy of your `basic-react-template`. The game should begin with playing cards face down, tell the user how many matches are possible, keep track of how many matches the user has and countdown to limit the time the user has to find all the matches. Build the project by fulfilling the user stories below.

### User Stories

#### View Card Grid
1. **As a user,** I want to see a grid of cards when the game loads, so that I can start playing immediately. The grid will have at least 16 cards and no more than 48. The cards will be "face down", displaying the back of the card. 

#### Flip Cards
2. **As a user,** I want to flip a card when I click on it, so that I can see the hidden side of the card. When I flip the first card, its face should display until I flip a second card. After I've flipped the second card and seen both cards (a short delay), they should automatically flip back, unless a match is found. While two unmatched cards are flipped, the user should not be able to flip another card.

#### Match Cards
3. **As a user,** I want to know if two flipped cards are a match. Cards that are a match (two 2s, two 10s, two Aces, two Kings, etc.) should stay faceup for the remainder of the game. Matched cards should not be clickable again.
   

#### Track Progress
4. **As a user,** I want to see the number of successful matches out of the total possible matches, so that I can track my progress in the game.

#### Game Timer
5. **As a user,** I want to see a timer that counts down from 10 minutes. The time should display time in MM:SS format (and M:SS when the minute value is below 10.) When the time reaches 0:00 the game ends, if the user has not already made all possible matches. The timer should start when the user clicks on the first card. It should stop when the game ends.

#### End Game
6. **As a user,** I want to see a completion message that displays how many matches I found, so that I know how well I did.

#### Highlight Updates
7. **As a user,** I want to see a highlight on the score and timer when they update, so that I can easily notice the changes.

#### Name Game
8. **As a user,** I want to know what game I am playing. On load, I want to see an `h1` displaying a name for the game. 

#### Game Rules
9. **As a user,** I want to understand the rules of the game. On load, I want to see a summary of how to play the game. I want to be able to easily refer back to this summary by scrolling or clicking at any time while I'm playing the game.

#### New Game
- **Extra Credit. As a user,** I want to be able to click a clickable element to start a new game once my current game has finished. I want each game to be unique with a randomly generated set of at least 16 cards picked from a standard "deck" of 52 playing cards. Each game should be unique with an algorithmically derived set of cards and total possible matches.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The game should be built using React and adhere to React best practices.
- The code should be clean, clear and well-organized.
- The project is due EOD on July 16.
- Submit the project without `node_modules` in your `toGrade` folder.
