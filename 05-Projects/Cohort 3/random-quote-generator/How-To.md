# Project Discovery Document Instructions

## Objective
Your task is to create a comprehensive planning document for your upcoming React.js project. This document, known as the `Project Discovery Document,` will lay the foundation for your development work and ensure you fully understand the requirements before you begin coding.

## Components of the Document

### 1. User Story Breakdown
- **Objective:** Understand and articulate the project requirements.
- **Instructions:**
  - Read each user story provided in the project description.
  - Rewrite each user story in your own words to ensure you understand it fully.
  - Break down each user story into smaller, manageable tasks that can be completed incrementally.
  - Prioritize these tasks based on their importance.

### 2. Wireframe
- **Objective:** Visualize the user interface and interaction flow of the application.
- **Instructions:**
  - Sketch the main screens of your application. You can use like Paint or simply draw them on paper.
  - Indicate the main components and elements on each screen, such as buttons, text fields, and images.
  - Show navigation flows between screens, if applicable.
  - Include annotations to describe the functionality of various UI elements.

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure your wireframe has your last name on it and submit it to a TA (if it's on paper), or put it in your `LASTNAME_QUOTE_DISCOVERY` directory.
- You may write your user story breakdown in a markdown file or a Libre Office file. Store it in your `LASTNAME_QUOTE_DISCOVERY`
- Ensure your `LASTNAME_QUOTE_DISCOVERY` by the due date.
- Ensure the directory is zipped and submit it along with your project.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Completeness:** All required components are included and thoroughly addressed.
- **Clarity:** The document is well-organized and easy to understand; wireframes are neat and annotated where necessary.
- **Insightfulness:** The breakdown shows a solid understanding of the project requirements and careful planning of the development approach.
