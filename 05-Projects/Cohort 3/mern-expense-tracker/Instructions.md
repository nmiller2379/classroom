# Expense Tracker user stories

This project will give you lots of practice as a full stack developer. You can build it in your `mern-template` or in your `mern-template-update` if you want to use React-Bootstrap. It is complete when all the user stories have been fulfilled. HINT: This is a large project. Remember what we do when the problem is too big for us. Breatk it down. Start small. Focus on one piece at a time. 

## User stories

- It is done when the page displays an h2 with the text "Expense Tracker"
- It is done when the page displays an h4 with the text "Your balance"
- It is done when the page displays an h1 that displays a dollar value representing the user's balance. (On load, with nothing in the database, the balance should be $0.00) This value should update as the user inputs revenue and expenses into the tracker
- It is done when the page displays an h4 with the text "income".
- It is done when the page displays an h4 with the text "expense".
- It is done when the page displays an element that displays the dollar value of the user's income (on load with nothing in the database this should be 0.00 and update when the user enters income)
- It is done when the page displays an element that displays the dollar value of the user's expenses (on load with nothing in the database, this should be 0.00 and update when the user enters expenses)
- It is done when the page displays an h3 with the text "History" (On load with nothing in the database this should be blank and update as the user inputs income or expenses)
- It is done when the page displays an h3 with the text "Add new transaction."
- It is done when the page displays an input with the label "Text" and an input with the placeholder text of "Enter text..."
- It is done when the page displays an input with the label "Amount" and "(negative = expense, positive = income)" and a value of 0.
- It is done when the page displays a button with the text "Add transaction". (When the user enters information into the inputs and clicks the button, the balance number updates to reflect the input, the income or expense numbers update to reflect the input and the history updates to reflect the input).
