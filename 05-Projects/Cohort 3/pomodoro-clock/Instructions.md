# Pomodoro Clock

A Pomodoro clock is a time management tool used to implement the Pomodoro Technique, a productivity method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique is designed to improve focus and efficiency by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Choose a Task**: Select a task you want to work on.
2. **Set the Timer**: Set a timer for 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro").
3. **Work on the Task**: Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. **Take a Short Break**: Take a 5-minute break.
5. **Repeat**: After four Pomodoros, take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes.

The Pomodoro clock itself can be a physical timer, an app, or a digital timer on your computer or phone. It helps users manage their time more effectively by creating a sense of urgency and encouraging regular breaks to maintain high productivity levels without burnout.

## Application

Working in a copy of your `basic-react-template`, build a pomodoro clock application by implementing the following user stories.

**User Story #1:** I can see an element with `id="break-label"` that contains a string (e.g. "Break Length").

**User Story #2:** I can see an element with `id="session-label"` that contains a string (e.g. "Session Length").

**User Story #3:** I can see two clickable elements with corresponding IDs: `id="break-decrement"` and `id="session-decrement"`.

**User Story #4:** I can see two clickable elements with corresponding IDs: `id="break-increment"` and `id="session-increment"`.

**User Story #5:** I can see an element with a corresponding `id="break-length"`, which by default (on load) displays a value of 5.

**User Story #6:** I can see an element with a corresponding `id="session-length"`, which by default displays a value of 25.

**User Story #7:** I can see an element with a corresponding `id="timer-label"`, that contains a string indicating a session is initialized (e.g. "Session").

**User Story #8:** I can see an element with corresponding `id="time-left"`. NOTE: Paused or running, the value in this field should always be displayed in mm:ss format (i.e. 25:00).

**User Story #9:** I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="start_stop"`.

**User Story #10:** I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="reset"`.

**User Story #11:** When I click the element with the id of `reset`, any running timer should be stopped, the value within `id="break-length"` should return to 5, the value within `id="session-length"` should return to 25, and the element with `id="time-left"` should reset to its default state.

**User Story #12:** When I click the element with the id of `break-decrement`, the value within `id="break-length"` decrements by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.

**User Story #13:** When I click the element with the id of `break-increment`, the value within `id="break-length"` increments by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.

**User Story #14:** When I click the element with the id of `session-decrement`, the value within `id="session-length"` decrements by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.

**User Story #15:** When I click the element with the id of `session-increment`, the value within `id="session-length"` increments by a value of 1, and I can see the updated value.

**User Story #16:** I should not be able to set a session or break length to <= 0.

**User Story #17:** I should not be able to set a session or break length to > 60.

**User Story #18:** When I first click the element with `id="start_stop"`, the timer should begin running from the value currently displayed in `id="session-length"`, even if the value has been incremented or decremented from the original value of 25.

**User Story #19:** If the timer is running, the element with the id of `time-left` should display the remaining time in mm:ss format (decrementing by a value of 1 and updating the display every 1000ms).

**User Story #20:** If the timer is running and I click the element with `id="start_stop"`, the countdown should pause.

**User Story #21:** If the timer is paused and I click the element with `id="start_stop"`, the countdown should resume running from the point at which it was paused.

**User Story #22:** When a session countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), and a new countdown begins, the element with the id of `timer-label` should display a string indicating a break has begun.

**User Story #23:** When a session countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), a new break countdown should begin, counting down from the value currently displayed in the `id="break-length"` element.

**User Story #24:** When a break countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), and a new countdown begins, the element with the id of `timer-label` should display a string indicating a session has begun.

**User Story #25:** When a break countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), a new session countdown should begin, counting down from the value currently displayed in the `id="session-length"` element.

**User Story #26:** When a countdown reaches zero (NOTE: timer MUST reach 00:00), a sound indicating that time is up should play. This should utilize an HTML5 audio tag and have a corresponding `id="beep"`.

**User Story #27:** The audio element with `id="beep"` must be 1 second or longer.

**User Story #28:** The audio element with the id of `beep` must stop playing and be rewound to the beginning when the element with the id of `reset` is clicked.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- The project must be built in React
- Manage global state using `useReducer` and the React context API
- Follow React best practices throughout, including with regard to components and modularization
- Project is due EOD on July 24

**Suggestions**
- To learn more about `useReducer`, go to https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer
- To learn more about the React context API, go to https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context
- Break Down the Project: Before starting, create a detailed plan breaking down the project into smaller tasks. This will help manage your time effectively and ensure all components are completed by the deadline.
