# Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

### Introduction

DOM Manipulation is a huge part of learning JavaScript and how the functionality of JavaScript works. DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, and remove elements from a website document. We are using JavaScript to now edit what we have on the page. This is an essential component in learning JavaScript because this is what your future clients and/or employers will want to see when you're in the field. With this rock, paper, scissors game you will be able to utilize all the skills we've taught you thus far, and allow you to display your abilities with the DOM.
