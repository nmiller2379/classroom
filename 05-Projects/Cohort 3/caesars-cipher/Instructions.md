# Caesar Cipher
Complete this project by fulfilling the user stories.

## Introduction
A Caesar Cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. For example, if we shifted the English language alphabet by 1, then we would encode A as B, M as N, and Z as A.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on. 

All letters will be uppercase.

In this activity, you will code a caesar cipher and submit it on April 19th, 2024. Please see our following user story to help you along with this process.

## User Story
```
1. It is done when I have a completed cipher.
2. It is done when the cipher can decode the given "SERR PBQR PNZC" string as "FREE CODE CAMP".
3. It is done when it can decode the other examples provided by PCC..
4.It is done when it can decode any strings similiar to the examples provided in PCC.
5. It is done when the correct output appears in your console.
6. It is done when I have proper file and folder structure.
7. It is done when I put notes inside of my code to explain the functionality.
8. It is done when I have a ReadMe.

## Extra Credit
You are not required to do the following, but extra credit points are available:

* Making a full website for the cipher
* Incorporating CSS with the website

## Conclusion

This will be a tough coding challenge, but with the skills learned so far you can do this! Good luck!
