# To-Do List Web App

Congratulations! You are a software engineer. With this project, you will build a web application that interacts with the user. That's the essence of software engineering. These user stories describe the **complete functionality and layout** of your to-do list project. Your goal is to build a fully working and user-friendly web page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is complete when the user stories below have been fulfilled and the page is fully functional.

---

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to **see a clear page title or header** so I understand what the app is for.
2. As a user, I want to **see short instructions or a welcome message** near the top of the page so I know how to use the app.
3. As a user, I want to **add a new task** using a text input and button so I can keep track of what I need to do.
4. As a user, I want to **see my list of tasks** appear in a clean, readable list underneath the form.
5. As a user, I want to **mark tasks as complete** with a button click so I can track my progress visually.
6. As a user, I want completed tasks to **look different from active tasks** (e.g., crossed out or faded) so I can easily tell them apart.
7. As a user, I want to **delete a task** if I don’t need it anymore so I can keep my list organized.
8. As a user, I want the app to **prevent empty tasks** from being added so my list stays useful and clean.
9. As a user, I want to **use the app without reloading the page** so it feels smooth and interactive.
10. As a user, I want the page to **look visually appealing** with at least basic CSS styles for layout, colors, spacing, and buttons and (optionally an image).

### File structure

Your project must use the below file structure to organize its components. This structure has the `index.html` document and `README.md` document at the root of the project directory. It also includes an assets directory for stylesheets, images and other assets used by the program, as well as a scripts directory for any scripts used by the program.

```plaintext
todo-app/
├── index.html
├── /assets
│   ├── style.css
│   └── logo.png         <-- optional image for branding or a main image on the page
├── /scripts
│   └── script.js
├── README.md

```

### Acceptance Criteria

- Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<form>`, `<ul>`) to structure the page clearly.
- Use consistent indentation and spacing in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use class or ID names that describe the role or purpose of each element (`task-list`, `add-task-btn`, etc.).
- Use clear, descriptive variable names that make the code easy for human readers.
- Make sure your code is readable and organized into sections.
- The code is well commented in the HTML, CSS and JS. The comments should help organize the code and explain key logic.
- The project includes a well-formatted and informative `README.md` file that helps others understand and use the project.
- The project uses the above file structure.
- Submit the project on a `ready-to-grade` branch in GitLab
- The project is due EOD May 8.
