Complete this project using HTML. If you would like to include some CSS styling you may, however, this is not a requirement of the project. The project is complete when the user stories below have been fulfilled.

## User Stories

2. I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.
3. I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.
4. I can see a form with id="survey-form".
5. Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".
6. Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".
7. If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
8. Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".
9. If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
10. If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
11. For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".
12. For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
