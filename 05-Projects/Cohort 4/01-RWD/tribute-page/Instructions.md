# Tribute Page

This project requires HTML and CSS. It is complete when all the user stories below have been fulfilled. Be sure to link your CSS document to your HTML document and submit clean, well-formatted and documented code.

## User Stories

1. **Title**: As a user, I can see a title with the subject's name at the top of the page.
   - The title element should have an id of `title`.
2. **Image**: As a user, I can see an image of the subject that is centered on the page.
   - This should use a figure element with an id of `img-div`
   - Within the `#img-div` element, you should have an `img` element with a corresponding id of `image`.
   - The image element should have a max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
   - The image element should be centered horizontally within its parent element.
3. **Image Caption**: As a user, I can see a caption under the image describing it.
   - Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding id of `img-caption` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`.
4. **Content Section**: As a user, I can see a section with a brief biography or description of the subject.
   - This should use an element with a corresponding id of `tribute-info`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
5. **Quote or Notable Information**: As a user, I can read a quote or notable fact about the subject.
6. **List of Achievements**: As a user, I can view a list of key achievements or milestones.
7. **Link to More Information**: As a user, I can click on a link to an external source for more details about the subject.
   - This should use an element with the id of `tribute-link`
   - HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab.
8. **Layout and Styling**: As a user, I can see a visually appealing and readable page layout.
9. **Responsive Design**: As a user, I can view a responsive page that looks good on different screen sizes.
10. **Semantic HTML**: As a user, I can see a well-structured page that uses appropriate semantic HTML elements.
    - The webpage should use semantic elements where appropriate throughout, including a `main` element with the id of `main`, which contains all other elements
