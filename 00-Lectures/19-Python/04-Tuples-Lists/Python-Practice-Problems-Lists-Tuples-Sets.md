# Python Practice Problems: Lists, Tuples & Sets

These practice problems reinforce key concepts from the "Lists, Tuples & Sets" lecture. No frameworks or imports are needed.

### ðŸ§  Practice Problem 1: List Manipulation

**Prompt:**  
Create a list of five of your favorite foods. Then:

1. Print the second item in the list.  
2. Replace the last item with `"pizza"`.  
3. Sort the list alphabetically.  
4. Print the updated list.

### ðŸ§  Practice Problem 2: List Comprehension Challenge

**Prompt:**  
Write a list comprehension that creates a list of the **first 10 even numbers**, starting with 0. Then print the list.

**Bonus:** Write the same logic using a `for` loop and compare.

### ðŸ§  Practice Problem 3: Tuple Packing & Unpacking

**Prompt:**  
Create a tuple representing a user:  
```python
("Alice", 29, "Designer")
```

Then:

1. Unpack the tuple into three separate variables.  
2. Print a sentence using those variables like:  
   `"Alice is a 29-year-old Designer."`

### ðŸ§  Practice Problem 4: Sets and Duplicates

**Prompt:**  
You have a list of email addresses, and some are duplicates:

```python
emails = ["a@example.com", "b@example.com", "a@example.com", "c@example.com"]
```

Write a program that:

1. Creates a set from the list to remove duplicates.  
2. Prints how many **unique** email addresses there are.  
3. Prints the set.

### ðŸ§  Practice Problem 5: Comparing Structures

**Prompt:**  
Youâ€™re given these two collections:

```python
fruits_list = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange"]
fruits_set = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
```

Write a few lines that:

1. Print both structures.  
2. Add `"kiwi"` to both.  
3. Explain (in a comment) what happens if you try to add `"apple"` again to each one.
