// Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string.

// Important: Your function should handle strings of any length â‰¥ 2 characters. For strings with exactly 2 characters, return an empty string.

  let finalString = "";
  for (let i = 1; i < str.length - 1; i++) {
    finalString += str[i];
