# Basic HTML Assessment

For this assessment, you'll do two things. First, you'll create a blog page. To complete the blog page, fulfill the user stories below. You do not need to use CSS, but you may. Second, **answer the short-answer questions** in this document below:

## User Stories

- **User Story #2**: As a user, I want to navigate easily through the blog by having a clear navigation bar with links to different sections of this page, such as "Home," "About," and "Contact."

- **User Story #3**: As a user, I want to read interesting and informative blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, a publication date, and well-organized content.

- **User Story #4**: As a user, I want to explore different categories or tags for the blog posts in a sidebar so that I can find content that matches my interests.

- **User Story #5**: As a user, when I click on the link in the sidebar, I should see the portion of this page that corresponds to the blog post linked in the sidebar.

- **User Story #6**: As a user, I want to learn more about the author by reading a brief bio and viewing a profile picture in the "About Me" section.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The assessment is due at the end of the day today.
2. Ensure your project includes: This document, an `index.html` (a `style.css` if desired) and the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. All of these documents should be at the root of your project directory.
3. Be sure to commit your work frequently during the assessment period. Commit messages should be meaningful, summarizing changes made. When your assessment is complete and your `master` branch is up to date, create a `ready-to-grade` branch and push your project to it. Then, go into GitLab and create a merge request. Once you have done this, you are finished. Congratulations!
