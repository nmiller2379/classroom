# Responsive Web Design Assessment

## Introduction

### Congratulations!
Some congratulations are in order for all you students who have made it this far. Coding is tough, but you're hanging in there. Now to get on with the assessment!

### Directions
As a person who just opened an adoption clinic, I had an idea with how to build the website. However, the person I initially hired quit after creating a mock-up. I am looking to hire some new developer talent to be able to build the vision I initially had for this. You will be rebuilding the website that you will be provided:

#### User Story
```
1. You will be given an example of a webpage called Snuggle Buddies, LLC to replicate.
2. You will have a wireframe to assist you in understanding the layout.
3. The project is done when you have 5 sections on the webpage consisting of a header, main, footer, and 2 asides.
4. You will have a header that consists of a navbar and large heading image with a logo.
5. The navbar will be fixed to the viewport and have 5 clickable links that take you to different sections of the page: 'Home', 'About Us', 'Our Founder', 'Community', and 'Our Mission'.
6. This navbar will stay at the top of the viewport.
7. One aside will be a contact form that uses input functionality.
8. The aside with the input also has a 'Pet of the Week' section.
