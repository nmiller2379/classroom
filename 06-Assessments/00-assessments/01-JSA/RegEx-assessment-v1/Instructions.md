# RegEx Assessment
This assessment consists of three coding challenges and four short-answer questions. Create a `scrip.js` file and an `index.html`. Ensure the two files are linked. Complete your coding challenges in the `script.js` and ensure that the correct ouptuts are logged to the console. Complete the short-answer questions in this `Instructions.md` document.

## Coding challenges
Be sure to include comments in your code to indicate which question you are answering, and also explain the code.

**1. Matching Color Codes**
Given a string containing CSS code, write a regular expression to match and extract all hexadecimal color codes (e.g., "#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"). Remember, hexadecimal color codes begin with "#" followed by exactly six characters that are either digits (0-9) or uppercase or lowercase letters "a" through "f". Log all matching color codes to your console.

**2. Extract Numbers**
Given a string containing alphanumeric characters, extract all numerical digits from the string. Log all digits to the console.

**3. Find the Right End-*ing***
Given a string containing various words, match all words that end with the letters "ing". Log all words ending in `ing` to the console.
