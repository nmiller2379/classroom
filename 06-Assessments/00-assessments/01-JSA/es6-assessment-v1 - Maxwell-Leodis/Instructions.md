## Getting started

Create an `app.js` file and an `index.html` file. Ensure the two are connected. Working in your `app.js` file, complete the follwoing coding challenges. HINT: When you're setting these files up, remember that you will be working with ES6 modules in this assessment.

Working in this document, answer the three short answer questions at the end.

## Coding tasks (3 points each)

1. Convert the following function into an arrow function:
   function stringLength(str) {
   console.log(`the length of "${str}" is:`, str.length);
   }

2. Given the following arrays, use the spread operator so that const oneToTen will include all numbers from 1-10.
   const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const oneToTen = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

3. Write a function that takes an unlimited amount of numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the arguments.

4. To accomplish this task, use ES6 modules. Modify the function in the `add.js` file so that it can be called in your `app.js` file. In your `app.js` file call the function from the `add.js` file so that it logs a number to your console. HINT: Remember you will be using http-server. To see changes in your console,  you'll need to do a hard refresh of your webpage. This is accomplished by clicking on your webpage and then hitting `Ctrl + F5` on your keyboard.
