# JavaScript OOP Assessment

This assessment is designed to test your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, focusing on the four pillars of OOP and the use of ES6 classes. Create an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file, ensure they are connected. Working in your `script.js` file complete the coding challenges. Be sure to include comments in your code to make clear which challenge your code completes. Working in this `Instructions.md` file answer the short answer questions.

## Coding Challenges (Up to 3 points each)

### Challenge 1: Define a Class
Define a class named `Book` with a constructor that takes three parameters: `title`, `author`, and `year`. Include a method named `getSummary()` that returns a string with the title, author, and year.

```javascript
// Your code goes in your script.js file
```

### Challenge 2: Inheritance
Extend the `Book` class to create a `ComicBook` class. The `ComicBook` class should have an additional property called `illustrator`. Override the `getSummary()` method to include the illustrator in the summary.

```javascript
// Your code goes in your script.js file
```

### Challenge 3: Static Method
Add a static method to the `Book` class named `isBook()` that takes an object and returns `true` if the object is an instance of `Book`, and `false` otherwise.

```javascript
// Your code goes in your script.js file
```
