## Getting started

Create a script.js file and an index.htmil file. Ensure the two are connected. Working in your script.js file, complete the follwoing coding challenges. HINT: When you're setting these files up, remember that you will be working with ES6 modules in this assessment.

Working in this document, answer the three short answer questions at the end.

## Coding tasks (3 points each)

1. Convert the following function into an arrow function:
   function stringLength(str) {
   console.log(`the length of "${str}" is:`, str.length);
   }

2. Given the following arrays, use the spread operator so that const oneToTen will include all numbers from 1-10.
   const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const oneToTen = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

3. Write a function that takes an unlimited amount of numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the arguments.

4. To accomplish this task, use ES6 modules. Modify the function in the add.js file so that it can be called in your script.js file. In your script.js file call the function from the add.js file so that it logs a number to your console. HINT: Be sure to use live server.

## Short answer questions (1 point each)

1. What is ES6?
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript language, introducing new syntax, features, and improvements to make coding more efficient and expressive.

2. What is a promise in JavaScript?
A promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing for more organized and manageable handling of asynchronous tasks.

3. What is object destructuring?
Object destructuring in JavaScript is a feature that allows for the extraction of multiple properties from an object into distinct variables in a concise and convenient manner.
